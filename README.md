# Blip Hunterz

Welcome to the **Blip Hunterz** repository, an integral part of ESIIL's 2024 Innovation Summit focused on big data for resilience and adaptation. This repository is the central hub for our team, encompassing our project overview, team member information, codebase, and more...


## Our Project
Our project aims to leverage long-term ecological data to better understand how climate change affects biological resilience across ecosystems. Insights provided by that data can then be used to inform decision-making around ecological restoration with the aim of increasing resilience in those ecosystems.
