# Group 3 -- Biodiversity resilience to climate change 

**Project Title: Bioflex**

 Success "Provocotive question"

  General: **In what ways can monitoring and decision-making enhance biodiversity resilience to climate change?**
  Specific: 

  decision-making: where to focus mgt, restoration, and conservation efforts
    
   **identify suitable biodiversity data soruces**
            leveraging long term data (e.g., LTER, LTAR, FIA, IMP - NPS inventory, BLM- AIM), including the long-term experiments, citizen science data
            bird breeding atlas
            what are the key climate variables as proxies of climate change?
            to inform decision-making and making policies towards env mgt such as ecological restoration, for instance, wetland and forest restoration for increased resilience

            Use WorldClim data - space for time substitution, to identify areas where climate has changed the most, which areas has changed the most

            Quantifying a biodiversity resilience - how quickly can biodiversity return to the historical avg. 
                use alpha diveristy-based biodiversity indices and measure how much that change over time from the baseline in response to climate change
