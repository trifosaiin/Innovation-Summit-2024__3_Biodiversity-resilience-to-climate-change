# Group 3 -- Biodiversity resilience to climate change 

!!! Success "Provocotive question"

    **In what ways can monitoring and decision-making enhance biodiversity resilience to climate change?**
    
            **identify suitable biodiversity data soruces**
            leveraging long term data (e.g., LTER, LTAR, FIA, IMP - NPS inventory, BLM- AIM), including the long-term experiments, citizen science data
            bird breeding atlas 
                        
            what are the key climate variables as proxies of climate change?
            to inform decision-making and making policies towards env mgt such as ecological restoration, for instance, wetland and forest restoration for increased resilience

            Use WorldClim data - space for time substitution, to identify areas where climate has changed the most, which areas has changed the most

            Quantifying a biodiversity resilience - how quickly can biodiversity return to the historical avg. 
                use alpha diveristy-based biodiversity indices and measure how much that change over time from the baseline in response to climate change
